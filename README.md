# bosonFit
A basic Python fitting function which fits a dataset of mass of particles decomposing into photons against a function representing both background noise and a model for the signal. The hardcoded dataset represents the masses (in GeV units) of potential particles decaying into two photons in the ATLAS detector at CERN. Any peak would correspond to a real particle having decayed while a smooth background represents chance coincidences or simply noise. The peak to fit at a bit above 125 GeV led to the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs particle at CERN in 2012.
